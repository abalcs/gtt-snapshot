Further Qualifying for AUS (T>Q):
Potentially useful info further qualifying clients should it arise in conversation
More on budget
○ $500 pp/pd is probably about as low as we can manage for an Audley trip then it really goes up from there. If clients really push you for a budget then generally $750 pp/pd is pretty average (4 stars, some tours, sprinkling
in small group tours)
○ Flag clients that discuss exchange rate to you a lot to the CSs - similarly to Japan, in country food and souvenirs will be cheap but don't expect a budget trip with us just because the exchange rate is good
○ We can arrange tickets for events (opera house, US open, NFL etc.) but it'll be more expensive and we don't add a whole lot of value to them. So generally we recommend that clients book tickets themselves and we will
accommodate everything around it
Types of travelers
○ AUS is great for Independent-minded travelers because car hire is so accessible which promotes self-exploration so while we do offer lots of hand holding, it's certainly not required
○ Return travelers:
○ Perth & Exmouth are great for AUS return travelers
○ Perth & Margaret river to the NW: great for scenery and wine country visits
○ Ningaloo Reef to the North: World heritage marine wonderland [you can swim with whale sharks in Ningaloo! (ethically done)]
□ Solid logistical pairing if clients are coming from SEA
○ Wine lovers:
○ South Oz (Adelaide area) runs the gambit on different types of wines that they grow, variety of red and whites
□ Tasmania in particular is world renowned for its sparkling wines, particularly Chardonnay and Pinot Nour blends rivaling Champagnes in quality
○ For ambitious clients (looking to fit a lot in a short amount of time):
○ Australia is wider than the width of the moon! Comparatively the size of the US so extremely unrealistic to do a lot in 6 days
Modes of Transport
○ We DO offer luxury trains
○ clients can travel in style while seeing the country-side and given the popularity with travelers, there is always urgency when securing their bookings - the sooner the better!
Where Does Audley bring value to Australia?
- Seamless itinerary builds that span the breadth of the country. All the logistics, tours, made for you. No reason to stress about such a huge trip
○ The logistics can be overwhelming to handle especially for a place that requires such a long flight
○ Almost limitless customizability of itinerary routes - we'll be realistic to optimize time
- ATS, our GHA have been a long standing partners of Audley - 15+ years, some of our longest standing, most respected partners
They can handle any # of things - work around Australia's popular events calendar that clients may not have foreseen
- Itineraries typically have more domestic flights than any other country, so having the security and the luxury of Audley and ATS eyes on your trip is a great service in the event of weather delays, cancellations, etc.
- Perceived safety: Land arrangements as Australia during peak season is prone to severe inclement weather (cyclones bush fires , and, tropical systems in general) that can impact excursions
○ We always get refunds on cancelled tours! (probably don't mention this unless they ask / are anxious about inclement weather)
○ They are amazing at modifying on the fly and providing unused service refunds when necessary
**Don't try to bring this up often as to not scare people, but can be beneficial if the client brings it up
- Australia is seemingly a very approachable country as it is English speaking and a lot of things can be done independently but knowing that a company is behind you to help handle perceived choices

ANZ + Pacific Page 1

Creating Urgency
- Australia is a big hub for a slew of events: F1, Australian open, concerts like Drake & Taylor Swift, Rugby tournaments and many others. These events put constraints on availability in the major cities, and also impact our
contracted rates
○ Locking in contracted rates earlier is incredibly beneficial before these events have hit the calendar!
- Seasonality
○ Peak season: Nov-March
▪ This is also the wet season in the northern 1/3 of the country
▪ Cyclones, tropical storms, thunderstorms
▪ Peak season also directly coincides with the holidays
Sydney is the most popular NYE tourist destination on the planet - harbor boat cruises, NYE related tours can be VERY difficult to fine - sometimes books out 2 years in advance. Set expectations to be flexible with
options
"Your CS will help you navigate any potential plan Bs in case availability is already dwindling"
○ Shoulder season: April & Sept/Oct
▪ Cooler temps, particularly in Uluru (80s & 90s vs 110 in the summer)
○ They can still go in June/July/Aug - it is a warm country
Just set expectations that some cities may be a bit cooler
- Dynamic pricing - unlike some other destinations that we work with, we don't have holds on land arrangements, so our quote expirations are short (72 hrs) and subject to change even within that period. "Why hesitate?"

Groups of Islands:
- Marquesas - No white sand beaches, little to no snorkeling but great for
culture futures/authentic traditional Polynesian culture and walking

- Tuamotus - best for snorkelers and divers
- Society (Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora, Raiatea, Taha’a, Huahine)

Tahiti: good for a 2-night stopover, more if they want history/museums/markets
Moorea: easy sub for folks who say they want Tahiti; cheaper than Bora Bora but
good experience.
- Adventure-oriented, lots of activities to do.
- Appeals to younger crowd.
Bora Bora:
- big emphasis on romantic trips; honeymoons, anniversaries, vow renewals
- snorkeling

Taha'a: much smaller, bit more culture to it, more boutique-y, appeals to
snorkelers or off the beaten path clients
- No commercial development
- Culture rich
- Great lagoon for diving/snorkeling
- Limited hotel product - more boutique
Raiatea:
- top yachting location
- nature lovers delight (including a flower found nowhere else in the world –
VERY long hike, don't raise it but clients may ask)
- best stops for snorkeling and diving in the Society Islands
- Polynesian culture - not resort style hotels, no beaches, need to be
independent.

Rangiroa and Tikehau in the Tuamotu – great for diving / marine and off the
beaten path experiences, but have luxury and boutique resorts
Cruises:
- There are some cruises we can offer, for example the Paul Gaugin. Typically 7
nights, Tahiti, Taha'a, Huahine, Bora Bora, Moorea (see below)

- Paul Gauguin For luxury island hopping / Aranui is a cruising freighter ship for
adventure travelers to remote island ports with off the grid experiences.

Distinguishing Between Regions
Tuesday, September 19, 2023

10:07 AM

AFRICA
• Has 2 distinct regions
• When traveling to Africa try and get people to focus on either East or Southern Africa NOT both
• Easier to accommodate a persons budget in Southern Africa compared to East Africa
• Good first Africa trip is either South Africa or Tanzania
• Handi-accessibility on : Definitely doable, but easier in driving countries like Tanzania vs flying
countries (Botswana, Kenya, South Africa)

EAST AFRICA – think the Lion King
DESTINATIONS
• Kenya and Tanzania
○ Classic safari
TANZANIA vs. KENYA - important that they know Southern & West Tanzania have different
approaches to safari & different costs/logistics
• Kenya more off roading excursions in conservancy areas
• Tanzania more national park focus
• Kenya more private conservancies
• Kenya is less ideal for driving – mostly small flights between destinations. Transfers
typically 3-5hrs by road.
• Night game drives walking safaris found more in Kenya Conservancies. Few
opportunities for night game drives in Tanzania, walking available but not
consistently
• Uganda and Rwanda
○ Gorilla and primate trekking destinations ** see Gorilla checking box

○ Kenya coast has nice white sand beaches Diani Beach
▪ Watamu
KENYA

○ Safari
▪ Landscapes lakes water based activities

see penguins, Eat Like A Local food tours. No shark cave diving.
• Winelands: Stellenbosch is the main destination. Can arrange private tours and tastings
or for a more leisurely approach we can book the Wine Tram – a hop on hop off
experience a few vineyards at their own pace. We also work with a specialist wine guide
who can take clients off the beaten path and every tour ends with a private braai
(barbecue) out in the countryside.
• Johannesburg: Apartheid museum, Sterkfontein Caves, Soweto – township that Nelson
Mandela grew up in but typically only used as a stopover between flights, minimal
touring

• Kruger National Park & surrounding reserves: Big five safari (lion, leopard, elephant,
buffalo, rhino) AGE RESTRICTION FOR SAFARI: 6+ years old on most safaris
• Honeyguide Khoka Moya (budget friendly) does not have an age restriction and
most private ones do not either (more expensive), some private villas do not have
age restrictions
• Eswatini: Not on sale
• Lesotho: maybe two properties to offer – do not promote but can sell if needed
Beaches: If clients want to end on the beach there are only a few properties we work
with in South Africa that offer the kind of tropical environment that clients are probably
picturing. If they are set on that they will need to fly to add on Mozambique (closest
option) or one of the Indian Ocean islands (Seychelles or Mauritius)
• Can offer self-drive (Garden Route or Kruger area)

Natural landscape: completely untouched, entirely undeveloped. No hunting, no fishing,
land is pristine and well cared for. 70% of Bhutan undeveloped, protected forest!
Because of this, limited # of tourists allowed, but with private guide you can see so much
and get inside scoop. Dramatic and unspoiled scenery.

Authentic and untouched social structure: as a landlocked Himalayan kingdom, it has
very limited exposure to outside world. Rustic lifestyle, lots of agriculture, heavy
Buddhist/spiritual focus.

• Nature/scenery/hiking/wildlife
• Art/architecture (dzongs, monasteries)

Phobjikha Valley/Gangtey: (pohb-jih-kuh, gahng-tee) Great region for hiking, and people

Punakha: very best dzong to visit located here. Terraced rice field scenery in the valley.
Much warmer climate due to lower sea level.

Bumthang: off the beaten path location. Central/western part of country. Rustic, even
less commercially developed than other major locations.
Dzongs: fortified palaces, traditional places of local government. Now sites of cultural
celebrations, holidays

Senses, Aman)
• All visitors to Bhutan are required through their visa to be with a driver and guide
from dawn until dusk. Clients will have them available and can be flexible about
schedule and time spent with them.
• Traveling to Bhutan with us is much more expensive than average since our prices
are higher for nicer accommodations than the typical hostel stay.
• Tours are a lot less structured than what we offer in other destinations. More
flexible and self-dictated, lends to a very authentic, outdoorsy experience.

Client Types
• Good for:
- Well-traveled, very active, cultural
immersion seekers,
intrepid/adventurous, usually
wealthy, often older travelers
• Okay for:
- Families: kids can go, but trips are
SUPER outdoorsy and mostly focused
on things like culture,
religion/spirituality, temples etc so
may not be appealing/engaging
- Accessibility: Proceed with caution!
GHAs are super, very supportive, kind,
helpful, very flexible and
accommodating. That being said,
there are a lot of limitations just due
to the altitude and rugged terrain.
- Safety note: most of the country is at
a very high altitude which can have an
effect on people, especially

- Folks with mobility issues could still go

Ryokan Accommodation: traditional Japanese accommodation and is a cultural
experience - traditional dining is the norm with kaiseki cuisine
Scenery: Most of the country is rural, rugged and mountainous outside the cities.

A lot of independence is needed to travel in Japan, private transfers other than for
airports are unusual, lots of self-guided train travel needed, and buses in more rural
areas. Clients will be given instructions in their welcome pack on how to get to locations
and meet the guides.

Hokkaido: Self-drive usually, driver and guide are expensive (have to pay for their
accommodations – usually high end clients)
Can arrange ski but not ski instructors, we are not ski specialists

Nao Shima (Art Island): We work with several properties there, but try for out clients to
stay at the Benessee House which hosts the huge contemporary art museum (budget
and availability pending of course). Guests at the hotel get extra access to the museum,
both early and after regular museum hours.
Self-Drive: More public transportation in Japan than compared to other Asia trips. Self drive mainly in Hokkaido (hiking and nature), and Kyushu for the national parks.
Private tours will often be picked up from the hotel or given a meeting place, shared
experiences we may give them the location and explain to use to public transit to get
there.
Give clients a pocket Wi-Fi to help them get around with their phone, can also use an esim. (CS discretion)
Flights: we have contracts with Japan, Delta, American, Korean, and Singapore Airlines.
However they are not always the best deals compared to what's available online. Tesia
said she will usually quote flights separately and then have client compare.

Details on specific
areas

Sarawak (Western):
- Orangutan rehab center and colonial city of Kuching
- Beach hotels
*slightly cheaper than Sabah --- if just doing Sarawak could start at $2.5k pp/pw. Main
reason it's cheaper is because doesn't have wild elephants or orangutan. Still have
sanctuaries but not wild
If you’re interested in the history and culture of Borneo, the southern state of Sarawak is the place to
go. The capital of Kuching is a fantastic base, and a great introduction to the country. Located along the
banks of the Sarawak River, it is a real melting pot of cultures, with beautiful temples and mosques
dotted throughout. Stroll along the waterside in the evening, listening to the musicians and watch the
sun set over the city. With a whole mix of Malay, Chinese and Indian cultures, the food here is fantastic,
and it's highly recommend to take a tour with one of our expert guides to learn about the significance of
the three ‘white rajahs.’

Sabah (Eastern): Does offer wild orangutans, and elephants tropical islands and
guaranteed sea turtles and world class diving. Offers Danum Valley - one of the more
expensive places in Borneo. (2 night stay adds on ~$1500 pp)
*more expensive than Sarawak, Sabah starts at around $4k pp/pw

Additional Details & Highlights of the various areas within the two main states :
In Sarawak:
Kuching: the capital city of Sarawak. It would be nice to spend a few nights here to explore the city and
the surrounding areas and explore the cultural heritage of the city as well as longhouses. You can do day
trips to national parks, visit Semenggoh Orang-utan Sanctuary (one of two sanctuaries in Malaysian
Borneo), take boat trips to Santubong Mangroves to see the Irrawaddy dolphins and more.

Bako National Park: Located outside Kuching. First, you will be transferred about 30 minutes by car to
the pier where you will board a speedboat out to the national park. Enjoy the beautiful views from on
board the boat as you approach the tip of the Muara Tebas Peninsula where Bako National Park is
located. Explore the park with your private ranger guide, who will be able to point out all types of
incredible flora and fauna. In the park, you are likely to spot wild boar, long tailed macaque, monitor
lizards, mouse deer, amongst many others. It is known as the best place to spot proboscis monkeys in
the wild. They are quite interesting looking creatures.

Mulu National Park: The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gunung Mulu National Park offers the kind of
adventure you would associate with the early exploration of Borneo. Agoraphobics need not shy away,
Mulu houses the largest cave passages in the world with Lang Cave standing at over 70m from ground
ASIA Page 33

Accommodations
3 - 5*

Client Types
• Good for:
- Wildlife lovers
- Off the beaten path seekers
- Divers and snorkelers
- Trekkers, (minimal culture in
Sarawak -- such as longhouses).

Mulu houses the largest cave passages in the world with Lang Cave standing at over 70m from ground
to ceiling and the way in which the park lights these caves allows you to gain some perspective in the
relative darkness. There are not too many accommodation options due it remote location but the Mulu
Marriott offers some great comfort and service after a long day of exploration.

In Sabah
The northern state of Sabah is considered the main home of Borneo’s wildlife, and is a must for anyone
interested in scenery, adventure and (of course) orang-utans!

Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center: Located in Sandakan. At the center, you have the opportunity
to observe the orangutans during the morning feeding. Watch as they swing through the trees to the
feeding platform full of fresh fruits for them to feast on. Often times, you will spot mothers with small
babies clinging to their backs. Spend the night at the Sepilok Nature Resort, a simple, yet very
comfortable accommodation only minutes away from the orangutan center.

Kinabatangan River: One of the best areas in the country to spot wildlife as it comes to you! Enjoy
cruising along the river and seeing various monkeys, birds, insects, and maybe even the occasional
pygmy elephant or crocodile on the riverbank. There are some lovely lodges to stay at along the river as
well. Including The Sukau Rainforest Lodge which was featured in National Geographic as being one of
the Most Unique Lodges in the world. I really enjoyed my time here and the wildlife is amazing.

Danum Valley: One of my favorite areas of the country! Especially the Borneo Rainforest Lodge which is
the only accommodation in the area. Very barefoot luxury. Delicious food, wonderful service. I saw wild
orangutans here, (a mother and baby) and it was incredible! They have sunrise canopy walks, night
safaris, night walks, tubing down the Danum River, light hikes to a beautiful vantage point overlooking
the river and resort, and much more. A must see during your time in Borneo. * Please note this is the
most sought-after accommodations and often booked out over a year in advance (more over the
summer) so we would need to check specific availability depending on your travel dates and base
your trip around the available room nights.

Mount Kinabalu: Amazing experience! Be sure you are physically fit and prepared for the climb, but it is
well worth it. As mentioned over the phone, the climb essentially takes 2 days and 1 overnight. The
climb up is quite steep but the views are lovely. Enjoy a night at Laban Rata, the simple accommodation
at base camp. Enjoy the comradery with other climbers as you rest your legs. It is set up similar to a
dormitory, where you will likely share a room with a few other climbers. Rise early in the morning
(2:00-3:00am) for your trek to the summit. Arrive at the top just in time to watch the sunrise over the
world below. * Please note that spaces are on a permit basis so again we would need to be flexible to
secure a spot.

Gaya Island, Sabah – After your adventure through Borneo, you may be in need of a touch of luxury and
some serious rest and relaxation on a beautiful beach; luckily this is something to be found in the north

ASIA Page 34

some serious rest and relaxation on a beautiful beach; luckily this is something to be found in the north
of Borneo. Gaya Island forms part of the protected Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park with its crystal
clear water, diverse marine life and virgin rainforest. There are treks and trails through the island,
snorkeling opportunities as well your choice of two first class resorts. My recommendation would be
the Gaya Island Resort offering spacious villas with great views of Mt Kinabalu and plenty of activities to
keep you occupied.

- Beachfront accommodations are better for folks who are less confident in their
swimming abilities. Also, for anyone with mobility issues, beach villas are closer to
resort
Basically only king rooms available – makes some 'friends' trips tougher on budget

Travelling during May or June is also significantly less expensive and less busy. This means
that you’ll have the full attention of the staff and service levels will be exceptionally high.

Pax Limit:

If you ever have a client that you feel is non-Audley in terms of budget, point them
towards the Manzil Downtown in Dubai or Velassaru/ Dhigali Maldives. That way they

Flight concerns: ** we can't operate any domestic flights within Nepal due to health and
safety concerns. All civil aviation in Nepal has been put on the EU blacklist due to a very

Summary of
changes

The best way in and out of Nepal is via flight into Kathmandu with a reputable and safe
internationally acclaimed airline such as Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways, or Emirates, etc.
Although all Nepali-operated airlines are indeed banned from EU airspace and have been
frequently criticized for poor maintenance and concerns surrounding passenger safety,
this doesn't apply to well established airlines such as Turkish, Emirates, Singapore Air, or
Qatar who are well known for their commitment to safety. In short, the concern
surrounding Nepal aviation is limited to Nepali airlines, not Nepali airspace. I hope that
makes sense.

- Some high end chains in major

Main destinations we sell are Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, some clients will fly into Almaty - Primarily locally owned 3*
- Yurt camps in Kyrgyzstan
in Kazakhstan. They can speak to their specialist about Turkmenistan but we are not
promoting it.
FROM ASHA TIL WE GET MORE INFO (some edits from Lauren and Louisa T)

In Kyrgyzstan it is mostly Yurt camps so glorified camping and it is a lot of time in cars and
hiking. Although the Eagle training is amazing to witness. In Uzbekistan we only work in
these few cities Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva.
I would recommend either a carry on sized suit case or backpacking style. The trains are
not handicap friendly and there are very few ramps. Most hotels unless a big 5 star do
not have elevators. So if they pack it they need to be able to carry it and lift it on and off
trains
Pretty much to make sure the clients are the right fit you have to try to turn them off it. If
they are still like yes we are fine with all that then they are perfect for the Stans
From Adam 1/7/26: We have guides who can do some light hiking and day trips and
some limited stuff but we don't have hiker-guides that do multi day treks or treks from A
to B. Light hiking only

• Phuket: Chinese, Malaysian, Indian and Thai cultural mix, island, mangrove trees

The Golden Triangle: historic triangle of opium production - "Chiang Rai" is the gateway to the golden triangle. Mid-range
travelers will stay in the city and 5 star plus clients can head to the Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp or the opulent
Four Seasons Tented Camp.

Common Pairings:
For people that have 15-18 days with flight time, you can stay in country or can add Angkor Wat in Cambodia (recommend at
least 3 or 4 nights in Cambodia alone)
Vietnam and Thailand is commonly asked about but there is so much to do in all of them but they should expect very fast

Mekong River Cruise: 3 to 4 or 7 nights, with a night or two before in Saigon (Vietnam),
and a night or two after to view the ruins of Siem Reap (Cambodia). The 3-4 night itin
ends in Phnom Penh.
- Do not recommend for pax with mobility issues, as there are multiple decks with
no elevators and the board/deboard the ship, there is a very narrow gang way.

War Interest:
- This is typically around the Saigon area such as Cu Chi tunnels and other attractions
in the city around the US involvement in the war
when planning trips there for Vietnam War vets, "we just say that we have a great team
on the ground who can locate old places of interest that may not exist anymore." We say
we do lots of trips for vets and have experience. we also would chat about how the
country has changed and if they want to do more of a cultural trip but with added focus
on the places they served during the war etc.
Caves: Central Vietnam has famous caves for adventurous travelers. Hang En clients can
do an overnight trek through but requires a reasonable level of physical fitness. Closes in
the peak rainy season Oct/Nov (exact dates may vary). Can also do day trips to other
caves if they do not want to camp. Accommodation choice is limited.

Solo Traveler:
$10-12k but
can go higher

For repeat clients: things in Hawaii aren't as privatized, it is a lot of shared/small group tours. The
experience in Hawaii will be different than their previous international trips with us because Hawaii is the
most expensive area in the U.S.

Oahu: Main island but not biggest. Honolulu, Pearl Harbor, very popular island. South has Honolulu and
north is a bit quieter. Authentic luau (no big crowds, low-key and traditional experience). Surf lessons,
catamaran, snorkel tour, tour of the island.
Kauai: 'Adventure Island'-- hiking, ziplining, kayaking etc. This is the island you would imagine Hawaii being
like. Na Pali Coast and Waimea (why-may-a) Canyon are most popular areas. Incredible scenery, Waimea
is Grand Canyon-esque. "Red dirt" beaches. Less traffic.
Maui: Most $$$ of bigger islands.
Mixture of Kauai & Oahu. Best place for self-driving, beautiful beaches and snorkeling, Haleakala volcano
crater sunrise hiking.
White sandy beaches. Best for relaxation, great for honeymooners and older couples. Road to Hana is here.
• Regarding the fire, no longer sell trips to Lahina. Only sell in Wailea

For Christmas
we
recommend $2k
per person per
night.

Hawaii (Big Island): Largest island, smallest population. Youngest island. Lots of volcanic activity, national
parks, star gazing (Maunakea), beautiful beaches. Manta ray night snorkeling. Black sand beaches, lava rock
fields.
Other less popular islands we do:
• Lanai: typically only send people to the 4 Seasons there, $$$ but all-inclusive. Could also do as day trip from
Maui.
• Molokai: smallest island, only 25 miles long, one hotel, very local feel. Good for folks who want to explore
on their own for 1-2 days. Tallest sea cliffs in the world! Can do a helicopter ride to see them.
Whale-watching: Maui has it best. "Whales like Maui, dolphins like Kauai".

Client Types
• Good for:
- Adventure

- Honeymooners
- Interested in Polynesian culture
- WWII history at Pearl Harbor.

Families: Oahu is best option, ok for
little kids. Other islands wouldn't be
very good, especially for smaller
children (too outdoorsy and age limits
on lots of tours).
Accessibility: Oahu can be really good
about it, hotels are all ADA compliant,
but we'd only recommend Oahu or
Maui since they're easiest to get
around. Other islands are too rural
and adventure-geared. Hawaii and
Kauai require more physical activity.

Scenic drives, wildlife(bears, elk, eagles, beavers, wolves), nature, casual to extreme
walking/hiking, sunrise/sunset wildlife tours, hiking tours, rafting, fly-fishing, kayaking,

Glacier Nat'l Park
Recommend time to go Mid June – Early October – the opening and closing of the park is weather
dependant. If they want to travel prior to mid June the roads may still be closed due to SNOW. Don’t
recommend.

WHAT TO EXPECT
• Penguins, whales, seals, birds
○ Beginning of the season will have more animal opps
○ Penguin babies come around mid-season (Jan time)
○ Whale migration takes place later in season (March)

CLASSIC CRUISES
• How to get there Flying or Cruising?
• FLYING
○ Leave from the tip of Chile on a charter flight to an island close to Antarctica. Fly to South
Shetland Islands and then sail bounce around the peninsula
○ *Best for those short on time or get sea sick

○ Normal flying trip length is 7-days
• CRUISE
○ Leave from Argentina and goes through the Drake Passage. Leaves from Ushuaia sail 2-days
down and 2-days on backend
○ Drake Passage notorious for tumultuous rough seas
○ *75-80% want to sail and want the right of passage. This route is cheaper than fly and sail
▪ Flying will add about 5k per person

We get a lot of inquiries for day trips to Volunteer Point off of a cruise. We do not do this
obviously, so just reach out and let them know - a lot of times this is because the cruise's
excursion is fully booked so they're looking for a 3rd party tour

Falklands- also possible to request. The Falkland Islands are sometimes included in

Audley gets tend to be people who just want a day trip on the islands. The reasons we
will be qualifying for it are because
1) we don’t sell it as a standalone destination
2) clients that inquire are usually just wanting day trips
3) but occasionally, those leads are open to booking the entire Antarctica portion with
us

○ Normal cruise trip will be about 9-10 days
○ Typically work with ships that have limits of 200 people or less
▪ *Mostly tend to work with ship sizes of 75 people
▪ Antarctica only lets 100 people on land in one particular area at once
ROOM TYPES AND ACCOMODATIONS
• Choice of cabin
○ Do they want window picture or porthole

▪ Porthole is cheaper option

• Fly cruise: fly from Puntas Arenas, fly to an island, sail from there (skips Drake
Passage, much more expensive option). Ex: Antarctica 21 cruise line
THESE TRIPS ARE DANGEROUS! Clients need to be physically able to a point
WE CAN OFFER HELICOPTER RIDES ON QUARK – THE ONLY SHIP THAT DOES IT,

○ Balconies not ideal and can be upwards of several thousand extra per person
WHAT TO EXPECT ONBOARD

• Plans will vary based on landing ice conditions
• 2-excursions a day

Whale watching: Each year from Sep-Nov, southern right whales (that specific species)
pass by the Valdes Peninsula (located about halfway down the eastern coast of the
country)

Vancouver Island: does not have Vancouver on it! Is across from the city. Has Victoria,
Tofino, Campbell River. Larger than Taiwan.
• Victoria: small harbor city, still large but smaller than Vancouver. Great for whalewatching, Zodiac tours, visit Parliament/do high tea at Fairmont Empress.
Butchart Gardens. Lots of history
• Tofino: "surfing capital of Canada" (huge bore tides). Black bear tours, kayaking,
small western surf town
• Campbell River: can get to remote lodges. Can do Zodiac tours, whale watching,
day bear viewing tours, indigenous touring
Canadian Rockies: 5 national parks with towering mountains, stunning turquoise lakes,
and abundant wildlife. We have some heli-hiking lodges
Jasper: Quintessential mountain towns, history of railway pioneers and explorers,
excellent wilderness with national parks. Fire in summer '24, manage expectations but
encourage to travel.

Banff: Alpine town which is an ideal base for exploring the Rockies, great outdoor
activities and scenery. Busy, over touristed but can visit Canmore 25 minutes away
which has small town vibes
Yukon/NW Territories: Excellent for Northern Lights (Sept-End of April)--Self drive,
wilderness. Gold rush history, animals, lots of days at leisure with suggestions from us.
EXCURSIONS/ACTIVITIES: Mountains, lakes, hikes, rafting, horseback riding, ziplining,
fishing, sightseeing, small group tours,skiing avail in some areas like Banff or Whistler
(should not be focus of trip), bear/elk/wildlife viewing (Not accessible for
walkers/wheelchairs), snowmobiling, dog sledding, snowshoeing in winter
Polar Bears
2 different experiences:
1. Churchill Bears: All-inclusive, most CS-recommended polar bear experience we
offer. Starts around $10k pp. 3 options. Churchill Wild is highest end, has a
collection of lodges on the tundra, more walking and boat based. Lazy Bear Lodge
is more mid-range, based in Churchill, tundra buggy tours. And Natural Habitat
who use a mid-low end hotel in Churchill and do daily tundra buggy tours. Also
options in summer with beluga whales. Packages include 1 night pre and post in
Winnipeg, and flights to/from Churchill.
2. Adventure Canada Expedition Cruise: Accommodates around 150 pax. They

operate to Arctic Canada, Greenland and Newfoundland and Labrador. Costs from
around $7-20k pp (typically 12k pp), minimum 12 nights. Single supplement
doable.
Other polar bear trip notes:
- Oct/Nov is peak season (Week after Halloween is absolute peak). Book no less
than 8-12 months in advance
- Big, armored buses take clients out onto tundra during their stay
- Tours on set dates. 6 nights would be absolute min, try to get them for 7 though
to account for travel time.
- Some places offer dog sledding, or a helicopter ride as other excursions.
- Children 8+ yrs are technically allowed, but would be super expensive, not a
common family trip and wouldn't be much fun for kids. No daycare, and clients
are expected to stay inside when not viewing bears.

Shortest cruise options is 3 nights, but do not recommend.
Can do a mix of cruise and land based for more flexibility and the potential for private
guiding. Land based is recommended for those with very specific dates (a lot of school
vacations, etc.) since cruises won't always align. Land based is also good for those who want
some beach time.

Excursions: cruises will have a set itinerary of excursions. Usually an am and a pm excursion
with a small group from the ship. So no real customization aspects on the cruise itself. You
will receive a breakdown of activities on the cruise before even booking showing what island,
level of difficulty, what wildlife you are likely to see, etc. Cruises are very structured and due
to the strict guidelines of the Galapagos National Park – you need to be with a guide at all
times.
Audley Value: we can tailor-make their time in Quito before the cruise (have some incredible
guides), help with accommodation on either end, and then the real value is having a
Specialist that will make sure you get the right vessel for your budget and that aligns with
your priorities. Will ensure the best experience.

Lima: big, metropolitan city, this is where they'll fly into. Wide range of city tours,
sparse ancient history. One of the top culinary cities in the world so food tours are
big. Cathedrals, architecture. Typically a 2-night stop.
Cusco: Original Incan capital. Very walkable. Beautiful Spanish colonial architecture,
cathedrals, cobblestone streets, great city tours. Just outside of the city you can see
Saqsaywaman (sack-sah-wah-mahn) which is an incredible Incan ruins site. Right at

Summary of
changes

Machu Picchu: Inca civilization, must go through Cusco or Sacred Valley. Use train
then bus (or hike). VERY remote, some are surprised by how much time it takes up in
a trip, be careful about that. Can't fit into a 4-5 day trip. Can take the train to Aguas
Calientes right next to the site or you can hike up to it.
• Two main approaches:
○ Train/bus: take train from Sacred Valley to Aguas Calientes, then bus up to
Machu Picchu
○ Hike (more expensive option)
▪ Short option: day hike, 'KM104 trek'
▪ Long option: very intensive, 4-5 days. Involves camping, porters setting
up site, etc.
Arequipa: Cool city, similar to Cusco. Has own unique history, great museums,
colonial architecture and cathedrals. Recommend checking it out if clients have the
time but more of an 'worthy add-on' than a 'must-see'.
Amazon: Southern part is the most popular and most affordable, lodges are open to
the jungle, we offer cruise too. Minimum 3 nights recommended.
• Two approaches:
○ Lodges: based out of Puerto Maltonado
○ Cruises: based out of Iquitos (northern Amazon), 4-5 days

Lake Titicaca: highest navigable lake in the world, borders Bolivia and Peru.
Floating islands are there. Can take a train ride from Cuzco to Lake Titicaca and then
to Arequipa, or fly in. Typically 2-night stop, one full day is enough. Day trips to
peninsula, ancient man-made islands, some OTBP cultural experiences. Again more
of an add-on than a must-see. Not big on accoms, more remote location.

Munich: Host of Oktoberfest. Classic castle scenes.

bears evidence of its Holy Roman Empire heritage through its architecture, which is
reminiscent of Florence.
Frankfurt: Largely modern metropolis with a gleaming skyline of glass, steel and concrete

(islands close down
mid Oct-April Santorini is the only

How to Feature: Stand alone, or combine with Italy
Most popular routing is likely Mykonos, Santorini, & Athens (potentially with one lesser island)

Pairs well with:
- Italy (easiest to do - lot of nonstop flights to the islands from Rome, Venice, Naples, & sometimes
Florence)
- Croatia gets asked to pair quite a bit but flights can be rather tricky
- Turkey (good option - a lot of historical overlap and similar vibes/architecture)
- Cyprus – now on sale

Athens: usually 2-3 nights at beginning or end of itinerary. Acropolis, street food
market tours, Temple of Zeus, day trips to Delphi and Peloponnese. Can be done as a
stop-over or as a stand-alone (with surrounding land areas) for clients interested/
specifically enquiring
High-speed Ferry is the common mode of transportation but small flights are possible
(usually a few hours for ferries). Many domestic flights route through Athens.
Athens Riviera offers high end beach less than an hour from central Athens

**Santorini will

interest in islands,
we can likely still
accommodate it,
just don't promise
Santorini

Pax Limit: 9+ not possible

- Hydra Totally car free island, transport by donkey while on island, 2hr from
Athens
- Milos: beaches and crystal clear water. great for active experiences, kayaking,
hiking, snorkeling. Beaches here but not proper sandy beaches - more typically
beautiful rocky shorelines
- Paros: architecture, sandy beaches, crystal waters.
- Naxos: sandy beaches, water activities
- Corfu: Ionian Island with Venetian style in the main town, monastaries and scenic
drives
- Island activities: catamaran tours (small group or private), hiking, kayaking, wine
tasting, archeological visits, cooking classes (small group or private), dining with
locals tours
○ *We do not currently do Corfu, Rhodes, Lemnos, Zakynthos, Lefkada*

Mykonos & Santorini: VERY popular, very expensive. Always fly to Santorini from
Athens (ferry is 5+ hours), ferry to Mykonos from Athens isn't too bad. Always ferries
in between islands.
Milos, Naxos, Paros: great 'off the beaten path' options.
Peloponnese: archeological sites, wine making region, great food hub (bee keeping
tours, ouzo tasting, meat and cheese tastings). Typically stay in Nafplio - cutesy little
seaside town with great beaches. Kayaking and hiking. Nice switch sell for those who
don't have the budget for islands or have limited time. (1 hr drive from Athens)

Olympia: Where ancient Olympic games began. Not much else to see there. In the
Peloponnese
Delphi: Heart of the Greek universe, can see Temple of Apollo & Oracle of Delphi.
(about 1.5 hrs north of Athens)
- Galaxidi – seaside town not far from Delphi for a day trip or 1N to break up other
journeys

Meteora: really crazy beautiful monasteries built into cliffs. Great for active clients –
hiking and biking. Kalambaka main town to stay, can also do small village Kastraki for
scenic walks and location near the cliffs
Thessaloniki - 2nd largest city in Greece, foodie destination, Byzantine churches, White
Tower
Nafplio - cute charming seaside town in the Peloponnese with nice hotels. Close to
Epidavros. Great for low budget or low-season travelers

Mainland areas are far away from each other, usually lots of 3-5 hour drives.
Don't do 'cruising' *have one 6 night private cruise option – super expensive Laura
hasn't even quoted it before
Self-drive: offered on mainland, Crete, Naxos, and Milos. Can do closer to 4k pp pw.
Not avail on Mykonos or Santorini.

Flights: always fly in and out of Athens. Spend a night there before flight or end trip
there. Some afternoon flight options give the chance to leave island in morning.
BA and Delta contracts, can book for clients but not always the better deal
If they ask why - a lot of the flights from the islands have quite a bit of delays which could risk missing the
international flight or they are super late at night

Client Types

• Good for:
• Families (some accommodations have
age limits)
Most bed and breakfast basis, not • Mythology lovers
• People who like adventure
many all-inclusive.
• Honeymooners
On islands: typical option is in town • Couples
or on beach.
For families: not always kid
friendly, some have age limits.
Santorini: not a lot of twin bed
options.
Enquiring about Private villas?
○ Not a lot of villas in Greece, some
hotels DO offer villa style rooms on
the property that fit 6-10 people
(higher-end $$$) - Especially seen in
Santorini

Enquiring about private boat sailing?
Greek Islands we cover:
○ We don't really do private charters
- Mykonos: nightlife and beaches! Proper, sandy beaches, popular beach clubs but
in Greece at all save for one in
isn't party specific despite the reputation - won't even see one if you don't want
Naxos/Paros with a set itinerary
to. Great for all ages. History - ancient archeological site on the island of Dilos (30
5 day option or 7 day option ($$$)
min boat ride away)
- Santorini: Picturesque blue domes, Cycladic Island along w Mykonos, Milos,
Naxos, and others
tons of stairs everywhere (not mobility friendly). Does not have a lot of beach
access - better for shopping, views, picturesque scenery, spas, and beautiful
hotels with infinity pools
**Mykonos & Santorini are the most enquired about and typically tightest with availability for that
reason - you don't have to go in depth in detail on all of the islands but letting them know that we offer
a lot of different options and asking if they are open to suggestions from the CS is incredibly helpful
- Crete: largest island (typically 2nd timers to Greece) comparable to Sicily. LOTS to do best for repeat Greece travelers because you can see so much history, beaches, food, hiking, and
overall a wide variety of offerings, home to the Minotaur at the Palace of Knossos

Cinque Terre: Five villages… hiking between each town. Or you can train between each

Sicily: An Island off the southern part, people usually go here for heritage trips, also cool
Italian, Africa, and Spanish influence. We offer self-drive.
Lake Region: offer Lake Como, stunning views of the Alps, great for relaxing or second

Lake Garda & Lake Maggiore are the hidden gems where Lake Como is the most

Very easy to get to from Milan and specifically the Milan airport

finally Lake Guarda.
The lakes region is
also seasonal (Peak
season runs midMay to MidSeptember)

Lots of cooking classes throughout the country
SKIP THE LINE: all guided tours offer fast passes, some can be offered without guides.

ALWAYS UNDER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVER FOR ITALY

Common Europe combos that are possible:

Most commonly successful country combos we see are:

Creating Urgency
- 2025:
○ Rome Jubilee has increased the # of tourists, so hotels are selling out much earlier
○ We have been booking 2025 trips since March 2024, and continue to see increased demand to plan for Italy 12+ months in advance
- 2026:
○ We can still get 1st picks of guides and hotels/room categories
○ Many travelers have put off their trip to Italy until 2026 due to the Jubilee
○ The $ is still strong against the Euro right now, so it's a great time to lock in trip rates
- ALWAYS:
○ Italy is always popular - period
○ Places like the Amalfi coast, Lake Como, Cinque terre, are seasonal and sell out early
○ "Shoulder season" (May/September) is now high season
○ Flexible travel dates? November/March are way less touristy and can still be lovely
GHA pricing can be tricky too far out (specifically Amalfi Coast, Cinque Terre, Lake Como, the lakes, anywhere with water) with our GHAs so try to sus out if they are ready to book asap for 2027 trip interest
** Anywhere with water specifically do have specific seasonality - an added note to create urgency

**a lot of the excursions in Italy offered at Audley , they certainly don't need to all be guided, we can get our clients skip-the-line tickets!
More on less popular destinations
Sorrento: a residential town that is an affordable alternative to the Amalfi coast!
Tons of hotels that are much less expensive, location is great (on the water) and you can actually see Mt. Vesuvius from Sorrento
Closer to Capri (easier boat ride)
Capri: Typically a day tour unless they are specifically requested. Notoriously an expensive islands and we don't have a lot of hotels that we work with on the island
**we don't offer the blue grotto. It's very touristy and not a very Audley experience
Matera: James bond movie reference, according to Italians, Matera is the oldest continuously inhabited place on Earth (perfect for history buffs)
Can be a great day trip from Puglia - only accessible by plane
Umbria: affordable alternative to Tuscany
Italian countryside that looks just like Tuscany, just as beautiful as Tuscany, but way less $$
Bigger cities - *Perugia (main city, home to chocolate festival in October, college town skews a bit younger), Orvieto (CS favorite - built on a tufa outcrop/rock, very cool, historical & surrounded by vineyards), Assisi
only difference is that there isn't a large metropolitan city like Florence in Tuscany
Cinque Terre: Impossible to make a day trip

We don’t offer self
drive

Winter Travel: We don't have too much winter product compared to summer/spring/fall.
If they want skiing we can provide accommodations, transfers, general guidance, but we
do not book the skiing for them.
Can offer snowshoeing, tobogganing, tubing, cross country skiing – a winter
wonderland feel
*Glacier Express train is sold out for the next of 2025 season*
Train Travel: clients will download SBB Mobile app for their train passes. Most travel
between locations done independently. Leave train ticket time open for clients to decide
how they feel that day, meaning most often we will not book transfers from train
stations – otherwise we would need a specific arrival time. Typically it's a short walk or
they haul a quick taxi.
Panoramic trains: essentially all trains will have those gorgeous big windows –
however the Glacier Express gets the most interest. Route: Zermatt and St Moritz. 5
course meal on board with wine. Glacier Express travels VERY slow, nearly an 8 hour
journey. Only worth it for excellence or first class tickets.
Switzerland has 4 panoramic trains: Glacier Express (St Moritz-Zermat and vice versa), Golden Pass
(Montreux-Interlaken or Lucerne, and vice versa), Gotthard Express (Lucerne to Lugano and vice versa), and
Bernina Express (St Moritz to Lugano and vice versa).

Self-drive: WE DONT OFFER - Grindelwald, Zermatt, and St Moritz basically don't allow
cars, very pedestrian heavy. Becomes an issue of finding parking for clients. Trains and
cable cars get them most locations

Flights: don't have a ton of contracts. Can sometimes get a deal so worth a quote but not
always the best value through us. Most likely flying in and out of Zurich for the most
direct options

ESE Page 101

Client Types
• Good for:
- Outdoorsy
- Adventurous people
- Off the beaten path
- Families
- Skiers (we do not organize skiing for
them)
- Hikers: mainly self-guide. Not a lot of
guided hiking or mountain tours, the
trails are VERY well marked

Zurich: small city, cute old town, pretty lake views, walking tours, usually 1 or 2 nights.
Typical upgraded room types
Great restaurants, good Michelin star option
YYop
include a lake or mountain view
Lucerne: 45 min from Zurich (can stay here and get to Zurich airport day of no problem),
cute old town, chocolate tastings, cruises on the lake, steepest cog train in the world (fun They LOVE their spas
for kids!), hiking, walking tours
All very casual, don't have too
Zermatt: one of Switzerland’s oldest and best-known mountain resorts, Matterhorn,
many UBER deluxe
usually 2 nights – CARS NOT ALLOWED
Newer destination for Audley, so
Bernese Oberland/Grindelwald: great for getting outdoors and hiking. Jungfraujoch –
don't have too many off the beaten
path/small town options
highest peak in Europe. Really fun for kids. Grindelwald is always a highlight.

St Moritz: posh little ski town. Kind of like Vale Colorado.

Tuesday, November 25, 2025

10:10 AM

We are now able to get Ski Passes and Ski Rentals in Switzerland!
We do NOT offer Ski Guides at this time

ONLY IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:
○ Adelboden–Lenk
○ Andermatt
○ Crans-Montana
○ Davos–Klosters
○ Engelberg–Titlis
○ Jungfrau Region (Interlaken, Grindelwald, Mürren, Wengen)
○ Saas-Fee
○ St. Moritz
○ Zermatt

When handling enquiries:
1. We must reiterate that while Audley can assist with passes, equipment, and accommodation, but
we are not ski experts.

2. GTT must set expectations around the level of advice we can offer, as we are not a ski provided.
The passes we can offer are to enhance the experience – not the whole experience.
3. GTT can continue to send/accept ski enquiries but must use the wording above.
Please log any/all ski-related enquiries so Risk can assess volume for future insurance
considerations. This is necessary for expansion, too

Wednesday, January 29, 2025

4:35 PM

Pass through must have:
• Clients top country
• Client must understand they will need to be flexible with budget
• Client must understand for the best value we suggest 3 days in each location to get the
Audley experience . If the client is insists we can still pass it through but we want to set the
expectation for the CS (NOTE: we would recommend 3 days min per location, to avoid any
confusion that someone can cover 2-3 cities within a country. )
Common Europe combos that are possible:
Most commonly successful country combos we see are:
•

Italy, Switzerland

• Recommend 3 days min per location – then a half to full day for transfers/travel
• Product is more in depth and cultural, we feel it requires time to be in each spot

Helpful tips
• 3 cities is the most successful way to do 3 countries, then the next easiest would be 3 countries
that border one another
For example:
○ London, Paris, Rome
○ Switz, Germany/Aus

would recommend Svalbard

Summary of

NO SELF-DRIVE OCT-APR, have to use a private driver (*Iceland had 3 domestic
airports that can also be used instead of driving)
- Private transfer trips are so expensive because the majority of our guides in Iceland live in either
Reykjavik or Akureyri, so if clients want to go to places outside of these cities, they’re not only
paying for 8 hours of touring per day but also paying for the guide’s accommodations as well.

*Recommend a full 2-weeks if a client wants to do the full ring
*Recommend full week for a Northern Lights trip
Capital: Reykjavik
Activities in Iceland:
- Hike on age-old glaciers
- Snorkel between diverging tectonic plates
- Hike into ice caves
- Learn how to cook on a local farm
- Bath in natural hot pool
- Chase the northern lights
- Go whale watching in a traditional Icelandic fishing boat
South Shore: Lots of opportunities for waterfalls
Golden Circle:
- Puffins: May to Sept
- Orca Whales: Winter
- Humpback Whales: Summer
Small group tours of Golden Circle and South Coast available during winter but
pricing would need to be given by CS.

If Client's ask about driving the Ring Road (whole circumference of Iceland)
- 24 hours if they didn’t stop at all (No bathroom breaks)
- 10 -12 the ring road (very fast paced)
- 2-3 weeks would be better (fasted paced but moving around every couple
of nights)

We do Madeira!

- whale watching May through end of summer
- fishing, biking, hiking. The clients are highly unlikely to spend much time hanging out on a beach and will need to be
prepared for adverse weather.
Madeira: we do it! Some direct flights from NYC
Volcanic island, mainly black pebble beaches but some manmade with sand. Weather unpredictable.
If somebody is going in the winter will be pretty rainy particular in the north so would keep more to the south
Porto: Some direct flights from Boston, second largest city. Overlooking Douro River Estuary, UNESCO recognized, busy in
peak months
Sao Miguel: Largest island with crater lakes, hot springs, tea plantations, and the capital of Ponta Delgada
Self-drive
- Only recommend in Southern Portugal and Northern Spain for those who aren't super comfortable.
- Easier for people to explore really recommend as long as people are comfortable driving. Driving in cities can be harder
because of narrow and/or steep roads.

We have a tour to Fatima, and clients can get to Estoril on their own on the train from Lisbon, but we have no
accommodations in either places. Fatima is a day trip from Lisbon, but people don't typically spend more time than that. If
they are looking to stay in either area we cannot help them.
We launched Portugal at Audley within the last 4 years, we pride ourselves in inspecting every little thing, so for now we
have built up a really solid base in Lisbon/surrounding, Porto and Douro Valley, and the Algarve. We are working on adding
more but we want to make sure that we don't expand too big too fast for the best possible experience

Notes

Ramadan Compared to
other countries in the
region UAE is very liberal
and there are few
closures during this
period.

Dubai best-known of the emirates and most glitzy / Loads to do here but can feel a bit inauthentic to
many. It’s a little like Vegas for a US comparison / We have properties in the old town, Jumeirah Beach,
The Palm.
Abu Dhabi capital of the UAE and more cultural and laid back than Dubai but still plenty to do / There is
the Lourve here and other museums due to open like the Guggenheim / Really geared towards families
and older couples.
RAK up near the Omani border at the Musandam Peninsula / Up and coming emirate / Have some
properties that have little beach bungalows / known for it’s outdoor activities like hiking, ziplining etc.
Fujairah probably the least known emirate that we offer / Smaller, more authentic accommodation
here / Nice for a few nights for something a little bit different and more relaxed.
Desert properties are scattered throughout

• There are few smaller properties in Fujairah
but overall NOT good for clients who like
small boutique properties.

• Family friendly
• Something for everyone especially
good for families, those who like high
end chain hotels and maybe those
who want to visit the ME but has
never gone before.
• Good entry point into the region

Christmas/NYE: last-minute
bookings are possible due to sheer
volume of accoms in the city, but
prices will skyrocket so it's best to
book at least 6-8 months in
advance.

For your knowledge and qualifying room requirements are 21 years of age plus to be alone in a cabin. If they are under 21 and in their own room it
needs to be interconnecting. However, interconnecting rooms are hard to find. If they need an interconnecting room they need to booked far in
advance, be flexible, or needs to be an adult and a teen in each room.

ESG Response
Monday, January 6, 2025

2:43 PM

FROM MARKETING: Audley has a robust ESG strategy in place and has always strived to ensure the travel
it arranges for clients is inherently respectful and considerate of the destinations visited. The addition of
ocean cruising is to meet demand from clients to explore some destinations more deeply as well as open
up access within them.

3:15 PM

Laura Miller's Words of Wisdom:
in all honesty as I've traveled with tiny tots, toddlers, tweens, teens and 20-somethings and at every
stage of pregnancy - the destination is secondary - a 1-year old will have no attention span and will be
out of sorts when their routine is thrown off by traveling to another time zone - they should go where
they want to go, but rather than trying to determine what might interest their 1-year old, they should
instead be focusing on what they want to do and where they want to go - but at the same time
understanding that they won't likely be able to partake in certain activities or experiences bringing a 1year old with them - ideally, however, a location that isn't museum heavy and instead offers a mix of
outdoor and select indoor options - think beaches, national parks, countries that offer great scenery potentially short boat trips, moderate hikes and walks, nature, wildlife, surroundings that stimulate but
not over stimulate -it's a fine line, but they can't expect to spend 4 hours in the Louvre or experience a
cooking class or walk through the streets of Tokyo - none of that will work - this is still vague I know, but
maybe gives you an idea ?

General Rule of Thumb:

1-9 = Audley wheelhouse
10-15 = challenging but can still deliver a good Audley trip
16-19 = tough to make it "Audley" but sometimes can be a good fit depending on
client wants/budget/ urgency to plan as room allotment becomes verryyy difficult
(These would be really helpful for GTT to flush out and check with CS/RSM if its
feasible)

20+ = no fly zone 99% of the time. Never seen it operated by Audley without
immense headaches or poor client experience

Thursday, January 27, 2022

3:25 PM

• Ladakh region- India (far North)
• We do from the UK office, but not from the US side. It's a fairly challenging part of the country to
travel through (incredibly low level accommodation, high altitude, limited services and logistic
challenges). Since we don't have a specialist who has travelled there in the US office, we can't
offer accurate advice and fear we a trip would not be able to deliver what they might expect from
Audley (and the high standard we hold ourselves to). Therefore, we don't offer in the US office.
• Japan- Mt.Fuji:
The window for climbing Fuji is really small: from early July to early Sept (so basically just 2 months out
of the year). We can help with it but only during those months (outside of that time it's dangerous,
people actually die).
• Dubai - have 3 CS's trained for Dubai, stop sell as a solo destination but we can organize it for a 2-3 day
stopover.
• Indonesia - Muslim country- so best not to broadcast LGBTQ+ relationships
• Vietnam: when planning trips there for Vietnam War vets, "we just say that we have a great

team on the ground who can locate old places of interest that may not exist anymore. We
say we do lots of trips for vets and have experience. we also would chat about how the
country has changed and if they want to do more of a cultural trip but with added focus on
the places they served during the war etc."
• China – Currently not selling since Caitlin Frost is no longer in team.

Africa Routings:
Clients looking to see South Africa, Botswana, and Tanzania need to know that a lot of their time in
country will be wasted by overnight hotel stays.
-If clients are willing: SUGGEST subbing Tanzania out for Kenya, it will be smoother.
Egypt Regions
Areas that we cover: Hurghada, Luxor, Aswan, Cairo, Alexandria.
Popular areas we either no longer service or don't have fortified relations: Siwa, Sinai Penisula, Sharm El
Sheik, Marsa Alam
River Cruising:
We offer any of AmaWaterways European options. So Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France,
Portugal being the main countries. Their itineraries hit a few others, but those are the countries we sell land
options for as well.

Ireland
"We pretty much cover the entire island, but can't always promise a lot of excursions and hotels
in the "Ancient East" as you might hear it called sometimes. There's an area South/Southeast of
Dublin that's mostly small villages and less touristy which we don't cover, but sometimes clients
with Irish heritage will ask about it"

France
• We do not have product in the cities of Marseille, Cannes, or Menton
-Nor do we offer self-drive in the French Riveria
England
- No accomodations in Cornwall
In England: what we cover
-London & day trips to the surrounding area (Canterbury, Dover, Brighton, Bath)
-Bath & The Cotswolds (most of the English countryside immediately to the West of London)
Destination Notes Page 144

-Bath & The Cotswolds (most of the English countryside immediately to the West of London)
-Lake District (Northern England area near Scotland)
In Scotland:
We cover a lot more here, so it's easier to list what we don't cover:
-North Coast 500 (NC 500), a stretch of very remote highland areas in the Northwest
-Inner and Outer Hebrides islands

Ireland
• Private driver better for large groups – have a 16 seater van available
Portugal
• we do not have off the beaten path in Portugal. We basically just have the Algarve/Lisbon
Area/Porto and Douro Valley area. We have hotels in a few other places but zero excursions
• we launched Portugal at Audley within the last 4 years, we pride ourselves in inspecting every
little thing, so for now we have built up a really solid base in Lisbon/surrounding, Porto and
Douro Valley, and the Algarve. We are working on adding more but we want to make sure that
we dont expand too big too fast for the best possible experience

Chile versus Argentina Patagonia:
-Chile Patagonia is famous for Torres Del Paine National Park and the "W" trek
-This side of Patagonia is more set up for tourism (I.e. cute towns, hiking, fishing, horseback riding,
vineyards, 4x4 vehicles etc.)
Vs.
-Argentina Patagonia is focused on glacier trekking. Perito Moreno Glacier
-Has small towns but not enough to see/keep clients interested for days
-More appealing for the independent, adventurous hiker

Really difficult to connect both sides of Patagonia by flights! Clients can see both by car but it’s a 5
hour drive
Typical Routing
-Santiago, Torres Del Paine(3 days), Perito Moreno(1 day), Buenos Aires
We can send clients to Ushuasia if they are looking to add it on to their Patagonia trip. It offers pretty
places to visit, but it is a port city for Antarctic boats.
-Getting there adds two domestic flights and usually isn't worth clients time or money
• Peru:
We can send clients to Nazca Lines, however they MUST book their own domestic flight there.
There have been many plane crashes, which is why we do not recommend.
• Q: Non USA Client Leads
○ A: Normally, the USO handles US and CAN clients, the UK handles clients from the Rest of the
World. With the time zones, we have taken more South American clients as they are easier for
the USO to handle. It means the clients need to pay in USD, but its easier for them so we keep
the client in the USO if we can cover that destination If the client is in Africa/Asia, I'd suggest
they were assigned to the UK.

• USA has to have at least 2 excursions and 5 nights accommodation or 1 excursion and a car hire. Must
be able to have place for Audley to add value (i.e. hide our mark up)
○ Can't do: Route 66 (very easy to plan yourself), South (SC), Great Lakes, skiing
○ Can do: New England, California, National Parks, Hawaii
○ New England – hotels not cheap, "even travelodges will run at $200 min a night and we don't
work with them" -Jack Tydeman

• Canada
○ Don't forget we CANNOT sell Canada to Canadians!
○ Questions to ask:
- Do you want self drive?
- Cities?
- Bears
○ Niagra Falls
- Cannot just do a trip for Niagra falls because there is not enough to do there, we can send
people to a quaint town called Niagra by the Lake and do a day trip to the falls
